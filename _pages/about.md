I'm an ML researcher interested in geospatial and environmental applications. Recently, I graduated from the University of Illinois with a degree in Engineering Physics. My recent and upcoming projects include:
- implementing interpretable ML frameworks for interpolating soil phosphorous distributions
- applying interpretable-by-design Neural Additive Model architectures to simulated climate data
- utilizing remote sensing imagery for the detection of methane pipeline leakages
  
In a broader context, I am interested in collaborating with environmental domain experts to create transparent, robust, and parsimonious ML systems that are attuned to their specific application area.
