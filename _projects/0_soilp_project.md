Understanding the spatial distribution of soil phosphorus in agricultural fields is of critical importance to reducing pollution runoff and prevent harmful algal blooms. Obtaining soil test samples across entire fields is expensive and laborious; thus, our goal is to develop ML systems which incorporate covariates derived from readily-available DEMs and soil content maps. We evaluating the performance of kriging, a spatial geostatistical method familiar to the soil mapping domain, alongside interpretable ML approaches such as XGBoost and Random Forest. 
  
Our main goals, then, are to
- determine key covariates in predicting soil phosphorus on agricultural fields, and
- assess different field sampling strategies to reduce costs. 
  
This project is currently underway; this page will be updated accordingly.
