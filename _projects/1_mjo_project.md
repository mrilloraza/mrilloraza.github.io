The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), an intraseasonal atmospheric variability phenomenon, is known to have to have a teleconnection to wintertime precipitation in Southern China. While neural network techniques can be used for weather forecasting using the state of the MJO, these methods often (1) lack interpretability, and (2) require amounts of training data that are unreachable purely using observations. To circumvent these issues, we (1) employ the inherently interpretable Neural Additive Model (NAM) architecture and (2) utilize training data sourced from large-ensemble climate simulations. While we found this teleconnection to be ill-represented in the simulation data used, we are continuing efforts to apply this modeling framework to other atmospheric phenomona.
